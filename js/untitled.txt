verse:
  A                                 Em7
Stop the clocks and turn the world around
      Dadd9            A
Let your love lay me down
             Em7          Dadd9            A
And when the night is over there'll be no sound
 A                              Em7
Lock the box and leave it all behind
      Dadd9             A
On the backseat of my mind
             Em7          Dadd9          A
And when the night is over where will I rise?

Fmaj7                G                 A
What if I'm already dead, how would I know?
Fmaj7                G                 E             A
What if I'm already dead, how would I know...

A                              Em7
Lost inside my head behind the wall
         Dadd9          A
Do they hear me when I call?
              Em7         Dadd9          A
But when the night is over where will I fall?
              Em7         Dadd9          A
And when the fight is over where will I fall?

Fmaj7                G                 A
What if I'm already dead, how would I know?
Fmaj7                G                 E      
What if I'm already dead, how would I know...

  A                                 Em7
Stop the clocks and turn the world around
      Dadd9           A
Let your love lay me down
             Em7          Dadd             A
And when the night is over there'll be no sound
             Em7          Dadd9            A
And now the night is over there'll be no sound
             Em7          Dadd9            A
And now my fight is over there'll be no sound...
